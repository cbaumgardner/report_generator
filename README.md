# Report Generator


## About

CLI application that takes two files, the columns to join on, and the columns from each file
that you want in the report and generates a JSON document. 


## Some Things To Be Aware Of

* This application is currently configured to support reading .csv and .parquet files. 
* If the files have overlapping columns, the application will extract the file name (excluding extension) and append to the column name to differentiate.
* Instead of pandas, dask dataframes are used in case the files are too large to be kept in memory.

  -file1          First file to read.
